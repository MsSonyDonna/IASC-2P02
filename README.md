# IASC-2P02

## About ME:
I am a creative person who is also a fulltime employee, mom, grandmother, and a current student of IASC, finishing up my Honours Degree. I am quickly discovering Digital Humanities is a fascinating field of study and one I hope to pursue with continued studies past my BSc.
