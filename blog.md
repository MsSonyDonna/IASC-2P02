# Digital Scholarship Blog

## Prompt: 

|As Kirschenbaum, Alvarado, and Ramsay have variously argued, the digital humanities draws from a number of established disciplines and research methods. This is a terrible idea. Digital humanities research attempts to combine two things that are fundamentally incompatible: the sciences and the humanities. Empirical or scientiﬁc approaches believe in objective facts that stand on their own; humanities approaches believe that all truth exists from a subjective, human perspective. These two approaches are fundamentally at odds with each other, and they can never be combined. Give it up, dh!:

## So allowing Science in Digital Scholarship: Will it really work?
