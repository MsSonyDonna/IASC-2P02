# Digital Scholarship Blog

## Prompt: 

|*As Kirschenbaum, Alvarado, and Ramsay have variously argued, the digital humanities draws from a number of established disciplines and research methods. This is a terrible idea. Digital humanities research attempts to combine two things that are fundamentally incompatible: the sciences and the humanities. Empirical or scientiﬁc approaches believe in objective facts that stand on their own; humanities approaches believe that all truth exists from a subjective, human perspective. These two approaches are fundamentally at odds with each other, and they can never be combined. Give it up, dh!*

## So allowing Science in Digital Scholarship: Will it really work?

### ABSTRACT:

|The sciences versus humanities debate has been a long-standing from at least the early 1600’s when Galileo Galilei used his telescope to look at the night sky providing empirical evidence with what he witnessed. His observations began a schism between hard and soft science (Perazzini 112). Albeit there continues to be a natural tension between science and humanities, this doesn't necessarily make them incompatible. One can see this historically from the Galileo incident in 1609 throughout present day with such examples as Roberto Busa who started the planning of the Index Thomisticus in 1946 (Alvarado; Ramsay; Winter); Charles P. Snow with his talk *The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution* in 1959 (Alvarado;TĂUT 101) and current studies such as Federica Perazzini’s research in Gothic novels. Perhaps using science, technology, and scientific methods such as the use of algorithms to aid in Digital Humanities and their research is not such terrible idea after all. There are those who disagree, such as Rafael Alvarado when he states, “...none of these groups...has successfully demonstrated to the wider community of humanists that there are essential and irreplaceable gains to be had by the application of digital tools to the project of interpreting (and reinterpreting) the human record for the edification of society (Alvarado).” So the question bodes to be asked: What would research look like without scientific data/methods involved? I suggest the research would be beyond overwhelming and unnecessarily cumbersome. Using scientific methods of research can be good because of tools available which provides a way to address the billions of bytes (Perazzini 104) of information available and also helps in collaborative research. Besides these factors, as new knowledge evolves, I believe the use of algorithms will help revisit old research with a new purpose and lens as well as continue to provide a means of present research as there becomes new resources of data to mine and address the infinite aspect of information. 

The humanities approach believes that all truth exists from a subjective, human perspective. Ultimately there is an infinite research potential as knowledge is ever changing, alongside our understanding. Alvarado believes “...when looking at the humanities it is meant to be with a lens towards new knowledge as we continue to learn more about the era the text, literature, artwork first evolved, published, created (Alvarado).”



I believe when Val Cordrin TĂUT suggests that “the Digital Humanities can be a space where new tools and research methods are created and tested (TĂUT 103)” we could add to this vision within the lens. This would seem to embrace the idea of using scientific methods for usage in interpreting data from the literature and digital repositories. Franco Moretti’s example (1960s) in "taking up data mining and visualization to perform ‘distance readings' of hundreds, thousands, or even millions of books at a time (Kirschenbaum)" was a part of this 'revolution' also. Within a different context, algorithms were also used to verify found Jackson Pollock paintings legitimate when others were  claiming their paintings to be his (Christie) showing these combined methods are not just significant for literary works.  As TĂUT genuinely feels that there is not substantial incompatibility between Humanities and technology (104), it actually seems a good fit to use science as an aid to gather data. 

A huge reason to embrace the use of these methods is due to the sheer volume of data to be explored in the field of Digital Humanities. According to Federica Perazzini “the big data revolution has been a major catalyst in changing the way the relationships within and among pieces of information are now understood (Perazzini 101).” Moretti spoke of the limitations of only graphing 200 novels out of the many thousands of novels written during the time (Moretti 67). Richard A. Hawkins lists many examples of text digitization encoding projects spanning the decades (Hawkins 77-85). Whereas his main focus is the use of big data in historical research he also discusses the massive about of information in current archived information (77). Through his own observations Moretti validated the need when it came to his own research while acknowledging his own need for relying completely on others work (Moretti 80). When Federica did her research on Gothic novels ultimately she only chose 174 (Perazzini 104) out of the 519 (103) novels published from 1764 to 1832 (104). 

Another consideration we need to keep in mind is the ultimate purpose of our research. Drucker believed visualization was important. That we need to create forms to understand what we are seeing when studying historical context and why seeing the graphs produced by these means is important. Ultimately, our goal is to think of the structure behind the words (Drucker; Christie). Adding to this perspective Alvarado claims there is a “group of statistical critics, extending from Father Busa and to Franco Moretti and Google, as well as other computational humanists who have been at it since the 1960 and who believe that counting words, applying the methods of computational linguistics, and observing patterns in large corpora will produce insights unreachable by mere reading (Alvarado).” 

### Conclusion. 

As already referenced by many scholars included in this blog, the use of scientific methods such as algorithms to mine data from corpora to prove new insights does not take away from the subjectiveness of the interpretation, nor limit the use of how one researches digital repositories and other literature. “To a humanist, computational technology is potentially tool, text, and metaphor (Alvarado).” Current research that addresses this debate also is seen in Perazzini’s work amongst others. Whereas Kirschenbaum poses the question, “Subjective phenomena subjective experience...is this where algorithms could pick out non subjective points amidst the subjective to verify claims or effects of data (Kirschenbaum)”; Federica has shown in her own research that algorithms do pick up key terms as it was with an specially designed algorithm in which four key terms that were of significant motifs of gothic novels in her corpora were independently found (Perazzini 109). 

  Stephen Ramsay believes science differs significantly from the humanities in that it seeks singular answers to the problems under the discussions (Ramsay 15), but is this necessarily true? Or is it rather as Val Codrin believes, that “the core argument is that the division between humanities and technoscience has to be broken down into two distinct levels. The first one concerns the exclusionary structure of the digital field, while the second encompasses the circulation and the institutional valuation of knowledge in Humanities (TĂUT 101).” Even within the use of technoscience, interpretation can still be subjective despite the aid scientific data can provide. I would suggest, instead of fighting against the natural tension humanities and science brings, let us embrace them and continue to explore ways to blend them together.
