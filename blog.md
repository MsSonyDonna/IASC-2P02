# Digital Scholarship Blog

## Prompt: 

|As Kirschenbaum, Alvarado, and Ramsay have variously argued, the digital humanities draws from a number of established disciplines and research methods. This is a terrible idea. Digital humanities research attempts to combine two things that are fundamentally incompatible: the sciences and the humanities. Empirical or scientiﬁc approaches believe in objective facts that stand on their own; humanities approaches believe that all truth exists from a subjective, human perspective. These two approaches are fundamentally at odds with each other, and they can never be combined. Give it up, dh!:

## So allowing Science in Digital Scholarship: Will it really work?

###ABSTACT:

Sciences versus Humanities has been a long-standing argument from at least the early 1600’s when Galileo Galilei used his telescope to look at the night sky which provided empirical evidence he saw marked a schism between hard and soft science (Perazzini 112). Albeit there is a natural tension between science and humanities,  this doesn't necessarily make them incompatible. One sees the evolvement of Galileo in 1609 (Perazzini 112) throughout present day with such examples as Roberto Busa who started the planning of the Index Thomisticus in 1946 ; Charles P. Snow with his talk “The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution” in 1959; in using science, technology, and scientific methods such as the use of algorithms to aid in Digital Humanities and their research. (Alvarado; Perazzini 112; Moretti ; TĂUT ; Winter). There are those who disagree, such as Alvarado when he states that, ...none of these groups...has successfully demonstrated to the wider community of humanists that there are essential and irreplaceable gains to be had by the application of digital tools to the project of interpreting (and reinterpreting) the human record for the edification of society (Alvarado).What would research look like without scientific data involved? I suggest the task would be beyond overwhelming and unnecessary. Good because of tools available, a way to address the billions of bytes (Perazzini 104) of information available and also helps in collaborative research. Besides these factors, as new knowledge evolves, I believe the use of algorithms will help revisit old research with a new purpose and lens as well as continue to provide a means of present research as there becomes new resources of data to mine.
