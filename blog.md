# Digital Scholarship Blog

## Prompt: 

|As Kirschenbaum, Alvarado, and Ramsay have variously argued, the digital humanities draws from a number of established disciplines and research methods. This is a terrible idea. Digital humanities research attempts to combine two things that are fundamentally incompatible: the sciences and the humanities. Empirical or scientiﬁc approaches believe in objective facts that stand on their own; humanities approaches believe that all truth exists from a subjective, human perspective. These two approaches are fundamentally at odds with each other, and they can never be combined. Give it up, dh!:

## So allowing Scientific Methods in Digital Scholarship: Will it really work? 

**...not an object which stands by itself and which offers the same face to each reader in each period.** - *Hans Robert Jauss', "horizon of expections"*

There is much written concerning Scientific research versus research in Digital Scholarship. As mentioned by Ramsay, where computers in humanities can be a welcome relief from the radical skepticism of contemporary humanistic thought. p.ix.
