# Digital Scholarship Blog

## Prompt: 

|As Kirschenbaum, Alvarado, and Ramsay have variously argued, the digital humanities draws from a number of established disciplines and research methods. This is a terrible idea. Digital humanities research attempts to combine two things that are fundamentally incompatible: the sciences and the humanities. Empirical or scientiﬁc approaches believe in objective facts that stand on their own; humanities approaches believe that all truth exists from a subjective, human perspective. These two approaches are fundamentally at odds with each other, and they can never be combined. Give it up, dh!:

## So allowing Scientific Methods in Digital Scholarship: Will it really work? 

|||**...not an object which stands by itself and which offers the same face to each reader in each period.** - *Hans Robert Jauss', "horizon of expections"*:

A terrible idea would be to ignore the value of combining the sciences and the humanities. True, there is a natural tension between science and humanities, understandably so as science is considered a pure data and humanities is subjective but this doesn't necessarily make them incompatible. What would research look like without scientific data involved? One can see an evolvement of Galileo in 1609 when he (Perazzini 112) throughout present day with such examples as Roberto Busa who started the details of the Index Thomisticus in 1949 ; Charles P. Snow with his talk “The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution in 1959; 
(Alvarado; Perazzini 112; Moretti ; TĂUT ; Winter).  Good because of tools available, a way to address the billions of bytes (Perazzini 104) of information available and also helps in collaborative research. Besides these factors, as new knowledge evolves, I believe the use of algorithms and will help revisit old research with a new purpose and lens as well as continue to provide a means of present research as there becomes new resources of data to mine. While there is the danger for OCR documents to not be read well due to failed scans (Hawkins ) there still is much value to be found in them.

Humanities approaches believe that all truth exists from a subjective, human perspective. “...when looking at the humanities it is meant to be with a lens towards new knowledge as we continue to learn more about the era the text/literature/artwork first evolved, was published, created (Ramsay ). 

Through his own observations Moretti validated the need to science when it came to his own research. “...the gathering of data is obviously crucial, and I decided to rely entirely on other people’s work” (Moretti 80). To some degree this possibility was set up by all the large-scale digitization projects out there. How would one interpret the billions of bytes of information out there?  Large scale research possible as a result. As Franco Moretti delved into the complexities of reviewing the large massive amount  of literature text (Moretti 67) in the thousands, how would one mine this information without algorithms to aid in their research? Research it if without scientific methods? “But science differs significantly from the humanities in that it seeks singular answers to the problems under the discussions” (Ramsay 15). 

“The advent of  of large-scale text digitization projects, the most significant being Google books, with scholars like Franco Moretti taking up data mining and visualization to perform ‘distance readings” of hundreds, thousands, or even millions of books at a time.” 

As asked during lecture, Can the computer interpret a text? 

As shown by Federica Perazzini’s study of Gothic novels, the algorithm used, picked out the words that truly did emphasize the genre when picking out the words, usurpation, seduction, lunacy, and confinement (Perazzini 109). Yes, you can use algorithms to further the studies in Digital Humanities. According to Federica Perazzini the big data revolution has been a major catalyst in changing the way the relationships within and among pieces of information are now understood” (Perazzini 101) .

There are those who disagree, such as Alvarado when he states that “...none of these groups...has successfully demonstrated to the wider community of humanists that there are essential and irreplaceable gains to be had by the application of digital tools to the project of interpreting (and reinterpreting) the human record for the edification of society” (Alvarado).

Body. 
 Even within the chosen studies of a few of the scholars I’ve reviewed, they had to limit the number of novels they reviewed in their own research. Moretti spoke of the limitations of only graphing 200 novels out of the man thousands of novels written during the time (Moretti ). As he widened the he acknowledged that it was through the use of other’s When Federica did her research on Gothic novels ultimately she only chose 174 (Perazzini 104) out of the 519 (Perazzini 103) novels published from 1764 to 1832 (Perazzini 104). 

 As suggested by Val Cordrin TĂUT Digital Humanities can be a space where new tools and research methods are created and tested (TĂUT 103). This would seem to embrace the idea of using scientific methods for usage in interpreting data from the literature and digital repositories . TĂUT genuinely feels that there is not substantial incompatibility between Humanities and technology” (TĂUT 104).

“Common methodological outlook than investment in any one specific set of texts or even technologies. + social undertaking”(Kirschenbaum).

[algorithms to pick up on specific data to make claims?]

Perhaps one reason  [sic] to add scientific data into mix is because there is   art has traditionally been a constant tension even with in trying to define Digital Humanities (DH) as shown in [? my notes on p103 of VCT)

“...there is a long tradition of text-based data processing that was within the capabilities of even some of the earliest computer systems and that has for decades fed research in fields like stylistics, linguistics, and author attribution studies, all heavily associated with English departments” (Kirschenbaum).

“, Alongside these there is a long running group of statistical critics, extending from Father Busa and to Franco Moretti and Google, as well as other computational humanists who have been at it since the 1960 and who believe that counting words, applying the methods of computational linguistics, and observing patterns in large corpora will produce insights unreachable by mere reading (Alvarado). 

“Text-based data is second to numeric data to manipulate (Kirschenbaum).

“Next to numeric input text has been by far the most tractable data type for computers to manipulate”


Numerous scholars have variously argued, the digital humanities draws from a number of established disciplines and research methods. 

Layering of knowledge. Helps us to understand better. Believe algorithms applied to corpora help flesh out information. Infinite way to grow/evolves

Conclusion. As Ramsay states , (Ramsay 8) “Literary-critical interpretation is not just a qulaitivate matter; it is also an insistently subjective manner of engagement” brought up by (Ramsay 8) by many scholars included in the paper, the use of scientific methods such as algorithms to mine data from corpora to prove new insites does not take away from the subjectiveness of the interpretation, nor limit the use of how one researches digital repositories and other literature. As 

“(Ramsay 9) But is it likewise the case that computational results--the data and visualizations that the computer generates when it seeks to quantize and measure textural phenomena--cannot be sure to engage in the sort of discussion that might lead one to such a conclusion”(Ramsay 9)? “The argument developed here demonstrates that there is no substantial incompatibility between Humanities and technology.” 

“Val Codrin TĂUT The core argument is that the division between humanities and technoscience has to be broken down into two distinct levels. The first one concerns the exclusionary structure of the digital field, while the second encompasses the circulation and the institutional valuation of knowledge in Humanities” (TĂUT )

“To a humanist, computational technology is potentially tool, text, and metaphor” (Avalrado).

Whereas Kirschenbaum poses the question,  Subjective phenomena subjective experience...is this where algorithms could pick out non subjective points amidst the subjective to verify claims or effects of data (Kirschenbaum),  Federica has shown in her own research that  it was with specially designed algorithm that independently found four key terms that were of significant motifs of gothic novels in her corpora. The terms are as follows: usurpation, seduction, lunacy, and confinement (Perazzini 109).
